# Contributing to QuLearn

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QuLearn! This document provides guidelines to make the contribution process as smooth as possible.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork & Create a Branch:** If you're not a part of the developer team, please fork the repository and create a new branch in your forked version to work on changes.

2. **Work on Your Change:** Make your changes on your new branch.

3. **Commit Your Changes:** Make sure your commits follow the Semantic Versioning format. This is important because the release changelog will be generated via semantic-versioning, and the merges will be squashed.

4. **Write a Good Commit Message:** This will help reviewers understand what changes you have made and why.

5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a merge request so your changes can be reviewed.

## Code Review Process

Before any code gets merged into the main branch, it needs to go through a code review process.

1. **Submit Your Pull Request:** Once you have finished making your changes, submit a pull request for review.

2. **Code Review:** At least one other developer will review your changes. They may provide feedback and request changes.

3. **Make Changes if Necessary:** If changes are requested during the code review, make those changes in your branch and then re-submit your pull request.

4. **Merge Changes into Main:** Once your changes have been approved, they will be merged into the main branch.

## CI Pipeline

We use a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to build, test, and validate code changes. When you submit a pull request, the CI pipeline will automatically run. Please ensure that your changes pass all the CI checks.

## Code of Conduct
