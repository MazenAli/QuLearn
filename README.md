# QuLearn

Welcome to QuLearn, a Python package designed to simplify the development and application of quantum and classical machine learning models. It includes a collection of QML applications from Fraunhofer ITWM.

## About

QuLearn is built on top of PyTorch and PennyLane, two well-established libraries in the realms of machine learning and quantum computing. Our goal is to streamline the process of setting up, training, and testing machine learning models, be they classical, quantum, or a mix of both.

QuLearn is suitable for various research applications and aims to democratize access to the exciting field of quantum machine learning. It serves as a platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to implement, experiment, and contribute to this rapidly evolving field.

QuLearn also houses QML applications from Fraunhofer ITWM.
